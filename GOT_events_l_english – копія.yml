 GOT_Generic.1.t: "The Red Riot"
 GOT_Generic.1.d: "What began as a protest by the smallfolk over food shortages and corrupt local rule quickly escalated into chaos. Armed with little more than tools and torches, the peasants stormed the town square—only to be met with brutal force. The clash left dozens dead, homes ablaze, and tensions at a breaking point. What was meant to be a demonstration has become a symbol of the deep divide festering beneath the surface."
 GOT_Generic.1.a: "Blood flows in the streets..."

 GOT_Generic.2.t: "Sabotage in the Workshops"
 GOT_Generic.2.desc: "Under the cover of night, saboteurs slipped into our workshops and smithies, setting fires and smashing what they could not steal. These were no mere thieves—they were agitators, radicals stirred by whispers of rebellion and the blood spilled during the Red Riot. Crucial arms and tools lie in ruin, our ability to equip the realm gravely weakened. The revolution brews not only in the streets, but in the forges as well."
 GOT_Generic.2.a: "Their treachery will not go unpunished."
 RI_commie_damage: "Several workshops have been sabotaged."
 
 GOT_Generic.3.t: "The March on [From.Capital.GetName]"
 GOT_Generic.3.d: "The gates of [From.Capital.GetName] have fallen. What began as scattered unrest in the villages and hamlets has swelled into a full-scale uprising. Peasant militias and dissident banners now fly above the city walls, the old lords either slain or vanished into exile. In their place rise the voices of the common folk—organizing, declaring, demanding. The revolution has not just arrived—it has prevailed."
 GOT_Generic.3.a: "The people now rule."
 
 GOT_Generic.4.t: "The Backlash of the Old Blood"
 GOT_Generic.4.d: "Though the revolution triumphed in [From.Capital.GetName], the fires of victory have not yet burned away the old order. Disgraced lords, bannermen, and hardened commanders rally in the hills and strongholds, unwilling to yield to the rule of peasants and radicals. Across the countryside, whispers of counter-rebellion stir. The struggle is not over—the old blood resists, and they do so with steel."
 GOT_Generic.4.a: "They cling to the past like drowning men to driftwood."

 GOT_Generic.6.t: "The Grand Assembly"
 GOT_Generic.6.d: "Across the realm, banners were raised—not for war, but for discourse. From lords and learned scribes to guildmasters and village spokesmen, voices gathered in what came to be known as the Grand Assembly. Within its great hall, the people debated, argued, and ultimately decided the course of our nation. Power has shifted—not to the mob, but to the many. A new chapter begins, forged not by the sword, but by the will of the people."
 GOT_Generic.6.a: "Let the people's voice be our guide."
 
 GOT_Generic.7.t: "The Old Guard Resists"
 GOT_Generic.7.d: "Though the Assembly now steers the fate of the realm, not all bend the knee to this new order. Noble houses whisper of betrayal, officers mutter about lawless rabble, and some corners of the army begin to stir with discontent. The promise of a more just realm threatens those who once ruled by bloodline and birthright. The road ahead will not be without its saboteurs, both in the shadows and in plain sight."
 GOT_Generic.7.a: "They fear the future we now build."

 GOT_Generic.8.t: "Unite the Kingdom"
 GOT_Generic.8.d: "The voices calling for reform have been silenced, and the realm returns to the old ways. A new council has been formed, but its makeup is familiar—those who once held power are back at the helm, pledging to restore the stability that has long been absent. The people watch in uneasy silence as the old order is re-established, though not without whispers of doubt and uncertainty in the streets. For some, the restoration of unity is a blessing; for others, a curse."
 GOT_Generic.8.a: "Let us restore the rightful order."

 GOT_Generic.9.t: "Discontent Among the People"
 GOT_Generic.9.d: "The return to tradition has not been welcomed by all. Though the old elites reclaim their positions, there are those who had dreamed of something more—a realm that might break free from its shackles and embrace a new era of opportunity. Now, their hopes lie in tatters, and anger brews in the hearts of the common folk. Protests in the streets and rumors of unrest grow louder, as the dream of change fades beneath the heavy hand of the old guard."
 GOT_Generic.9.a: "They do not understand what it takes to rule."

 GOT_Generic.10.t: "The Coup of the True Monarch"
 GOT_Generic.10.d: "The realm has fallen under the iron fist of a single leader. The streets now echo with the sound of disciplined boots and the banners of the new order. The old elites have bent the knee, and the people are expected to fall in line. Though the promise of strength and unity is proclaimed, many question whether this is the dawn of true power or the beginning of a dark chapter in the history of our land."
 GOT_Generic.10.a: "Strength through unity, power through fear."

 GOT_Generic.11.t: "The Resistance of the Hopeful"
 GOT_Generic.11.d: "Not all have accepted this new rule. In the shadows, a growing resistance stirs, led by those who once dreamed of freedom and equality. These rebels see the rise of the tyrant as a betrayal of the very values they once held dear. Now, their hopes have turned to anger, and whispers of rebellion grow louder by the day. They will stop at nothing to restore what has been taken from them."
 GOT_Generic.11.a: "We will not kneel to tyranny."

 GOT_Generic.12.t: "The Old Gods"
 GOT_Generic.12.d: "The Old Gods of the Forest have long been worshipped by the people of the North, a faith steeped in ancient traditions and rituals. With the growth of other religions and the rise of foreign influences, some now question whether it is time to renew our devotion to the Old Gods. The question stands: should we reaffirm our connection to these ancient deities, or continue following the faith that has dominated our realm for so long?"
 GOT_Generic.12.a: "Embrace This New Faith"
 GOT_Generic.12.b: "Keep Our Current Faith"
 GOT_Generic.12.c: "We Already Worship Them"
 
 GOT_Generic.13.t: "The Drowned God"
 GOT_Generic.13.d: "The faith of the Drowned God, worshipped by the people of the Iron Islands, speaks of strength, rebirth, and the will to overcome death. It is a faith built around the sea and its power, promising eternal life through drowning and revival. As the Ironborn grow ever more devout, the question remains: should we embrace the Drowned God fully, or stay loyal to our established beliefs?"
 GOT_Generic.13.a: "What Is Dead May Never Die"
 GOT_Generic.13.b: "Keep Our Current Faith"
 GOT_Generic.13.c: "We Already Worship Him"
 
 GOT_Generic.14.t: "The Lord of Light"
 GOT_Generic.14.d: "The Lord of Light, a mysterious and powerful deity, offers a vision of the future filled with fire, life, and light. His followers believe in the eternal battle between light and darkness, with his followers often guided by visions and prophecies. As this religion gains followers and influence, we must decide whether we will embrace the Lord of Light or continue following our existing faith."
 GOT_Generic.14.a: "The Night Is Dark And Full of Terrors"
 GOT_Generic.14.b: "Keep Our Current Faith"
 GOT_Generic.14.c: "We Already Worship Him"
 
 GOT_Generic.15.t: "The Way of Salt And Iron"
 GOT_Generic.15.d: "The Way of Salt and Iron is a sacred tradition of the Ironborn, a code that emphasizes strength, resilience, and the importance of the sea in shaping their identity. It is a brutal and unforgiving path, where survival and honor are paramount. The Ironborn view salt as a symbol of life, and iron as a symbol of their strength and death. As their influence grows, we must decide whether to adopt this tradition or maintain our own."
 GOT_Generic.15.a: "Adopt The Ironborn Tradition"
 GOT_Generic.15.b: "Keep Our Current Tradition"
 GOT_Generic.15.c: "We Already Have That Tradition"

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.8.t: "Who Shall Wear the Crown?"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.8.d: "With King Robert’s death, the fate of the realm rests heavy upon me. As Lord Regent, I must choose who will succeed him. Joffrey is named in Robert’s will, but doubts gnaw at my conscience. Stannis holds the lawful claim. Renly has support, though little right. And some whisper that I should claim the crown myself — but I am no king. Perhaps the realm needs not a monarch, but a steady hand to guide it through the storm."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.8.a: "Joffrey Baratheon shall be king."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.8.b: "The crown rightfully belongs to Stannis."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.8.c: "Renly has the backing to rule."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.8.e: "The realm needs no king — only a regent."


GOT_Diplomatic_Country.9.t: "The Lioness Roars"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.9.d: "With Eddard Stark defeated and Robert dead, the path to the Iron Throne lies clear. I can maintain control as Regent, letting the realm believe power rests in their king’s hands — whoever he or she may be. Joffrey is the rightful heir, though his temper worries even me. Tommen is kind and easily guided. Myrcella, though a girl, has a mind sharper than her brothers’. Or perhaps it's best I simply hold the reins myself, without the formality of a crown. The choice is mine. And I will not be questioned."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.9.a: "Remain Queen Regent — let the child rule in name only."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.9.b: "Crown Joffrey Baratheon as King."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.9.c: "Crown Tommen Baratheon as King."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.9.e: "Crown Myrcella Baratheon as Queen."

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.10.t: "Lord Stark's Betrayal"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.10.d: "Word has reached us that Lord Eddard Stark, acting as Regent, has spurned the clear line of succession. Instead of honoring Prince Joffrey’s claim, he has moved to crown another — Stannis, Renly, or even rule in Robert’s stead. This is nothing short of treason. The time has come to decide our response. Shall we strike swiftly and secure the capital, or wait for the opportune moment?"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.10.a: "Summon our banners. We march on King’s Landing!"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.10.b: "Patience. Our time will come."

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.11.t: "The Last Dragon Falls"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.11.d: "Viserys Targaryen is dead. The self-proclaimed king who once shouted of dragons and thrones now lies cold and forgotten. His death marks the end of his madness — and the rise of another. Daenerys, once the timid sister, now stands as the last known heir of House Targaryen. In the eyes of the faithful, she is the rightful Queen — the Mother of Dragons yet to come."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.11.a: "I will not be weak. I am the blood of the dragon."

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.12.t: "The Dragon Mocked"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.12.d: "They laughed at me. The blood of the dragon — laughed at like a jester in a savage court. I demanded my crown, as is my right, and they dared to lay hands on me. The khal treats me like a beggar, my sister forgets her place, and the Dothraki mutter in their barbarous tongue. But I will not be broken. I am the dragon. And they will learn that fire does not bend — it burns."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.12.a: "They will all pay. One day, I will show them."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.12.b: "No... not yet. I must be patient. I must endure."

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.13.t:0 "The Khal Lives!"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.13.d:0 "Drogo breathes! Though the wound was deep and the night long, the blood of the Great Stallion flows strong in his veins. Our Khal has risen from his mat, his gaze fierce, his grip firm. The witch’s magic may have played a part, but it was Drogo’s spirit that defeated death itself. The khalasar rejoices — their leader has returned."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.13.a:0 "He rides again!"

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.14.t:0 "The Khal Is Dead"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.14.d:0 "Khal Drogo, the Great Khal, has fallen. His blood spills no more, his strength is gone. Songs will be sung of his conquests and the fear he struck across the lands. But now, the khalasar stands at a crossroads — bloodriders murmur, and the mares whinny nervously. The Great Khal is no more. Who shall lead us now?"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.14.a:0 "We shall follow the Khaleesi, the Mother of Dragons!"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.14.b:0 "Khal Moro should lead us, his strength is undeniable!"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.14.c:0 "We do not need a single ruler. We are free to lead ourselves!"

 GOT_Diplomatic_Country.15.t: "The Matter of the Tournament"
 GOT_Diplomatic_Country.15.d: "King Renly has declared his rightful claim to the Iron Throne, and our banners rally in strength unmatched. Lords across Westeros cast their gaze south, wondering if we will march upon the capital and end the Lannister usurpation at once.\n\nYet, some counsel patience. A grand tourney, they say, would buy us time to gather allies and show the realm that King Renly's court is one of peace, prosperity, and strength. Others demand action now, before the enemy can prepare.\n\nThe eyes of the Seven Kingdoms are upon us. Will we answer with war—or with pageantry?"
 GOT_Diplomatic_Country.15.a: "We ride to war. The Iron Throne will be ours by right."
 GOT_Diplomatic_Country.15.b: "Let the banners rest for now. We will host a grand tournament."

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.16.t: "Theon's Offer"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.16.d: "The boy returns, cloaked in the wolf’s banners and burdened with Stark terms. He dares speak of peace and promises—offering Casterly Rock in exchange for our blades. Robb Stark would have us bind our fate to his, claiming it is the surest path to power. But we are Ironborn. We do not make deals—we take. Theon's loyalty is uncertain, his presence a reminder of our past defeat. Still, the offer is tempting. The time has come to choose: ally with the wolves, strike while they are distracted, or wait until the sea favors our strength."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.16.a: "We shall sail with the Starks—for now."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.16.b: "The North is weak. We take what is ours!"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.16.c: "Now is not the time for war."

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.17.t: "The Ironborn Path"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.17.d: "No envoy has come. No raven bears an offer. The North wages its war alone, leaving the Iron Islands to plot their own course. Balon Greyjoy sees weakness on all shores—chaos in the Westerlands, division in the North. Our fleets are ready. The men hunger for salt and plunder. The question now is not if we strike, but where: shall we raid the Westerlands while their golden lion sleeps, strike the North as vengeance for the old rebellion, or bide our time and await a more favorable tide?"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.17.a: "We raid the Westerlands—they are ripe for plunder!"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.17.b: "The North never broke us—we will remind them of that."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.17.c: "Let the storm pass. Our time will come."

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.18.t: "A New Recruit from King's Landing"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.18.d: "A black carriage rolls through the gates of Castle Black, bearing a man dressed more for court than for the cold. Janos Slynt, former Commander of the City Watch in King's Landing, arrives under royal command to take the black. Though he comes with titles and boasts of past glories, few here trust a man who served coin before honor."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.18.a: "He will learn humility like the rest."

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.19.t: "King Renly Survives"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.19.d: "Despite being grievously injured by the shadow birthed by Melisandre, I have survived. The pain is unbearable, but my ambition remains undeterred. Now, I must decide whether to seek vengeance against my brother Stannis for his treachery, or focus on securing the Crownlands for my claim to the throne."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.19.a: "It is time for retribution!"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.19.b: "The Crownlands are more important now"

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.20.t: "Renly Baratheon Assassinated!"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.20.d: "Renly Baratheon, the favored claimant of House Tyrell in the War of the Five Kings, has been slain by sorcery—cut down by a shadow birthed by Melisandre, priestess of R'hllor and ally of Stannis Baratheon. With their political betrothal shattered and their chosen king gone, House Tyrell must now decide its course: side with Stannis, align with the Iron Throne, or return to the Reach and stand aloof from this chaos."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.20.a: "Pledge ourselves to Stannis."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.20.b: "Side with the Crown—marry Margaery to Joffrey."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.20.c: "Return to the Reach. Let them all kill each other."

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.21.t: "The Fall of Winterfell"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.21.d: "A raven has arrived with grim news: Theon Greyjoy has betrayed House Stark and seized Winterfell. Our ancestral home is in enemy hands, and Bran and Rickon are missing. Lords loyal to us are furious, and many demand vengeance. We must decide how to respond to this outrage."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.21.a: "I will take back Winterfell and hang Theon myself!"

# GOT_Diplomatic_Country.22 – Tyrion Requests Casterly Rock
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.22.t: "A Request from Tyrion"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.22.d: "Tyrion, ever hungry for recognition, has approached me with a bold request: he wishes to be named Lord of Casterly Rock. Despite his cunning and recent service, the idea of placing my legacy in his hands is almost laughable. Yet, for all his flaws, he is still a Lannister by blood. Do I grant him what he desires—or remind him, once again, of his place?"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.22.a: "Very well. He shall be Lord of Casterly Rock."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.22.b: "I would rather let myself be consumed by maggots."

# GOT_Diplomatic_Country.23 – Tywin Grants Casterly Rock
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.23.t: "Granted Casterly Rock"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.23.d: "I half-expected mockery. A scornful laugh. A reminder of every insult I’ve ever suffered. But instead, he agreed. Tywin Lannister—my father—has granted me Casterly Rock. The seat of our house. The legacy I was never meant to hold. Perhaps this is a ploy, or a test. Perhaps he’s finally seen my worth. Either way, I’ve claimed what I was always denied."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.23.a: "So it’s finally mine…"

# GOT_Diplomatic_Country.24 – Tywin Rejects the Request
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.24.t: "Rejected by My Father"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.24.d: "I dared to ask. To claim what any other son would consider his birthright. But Tywin, in all his contempt, dismissed me without hesitation. No explanation. No pretense. Just cold, measured disdain. He said he would rather let himself be consumed by maggots. I should have expected nothing else—but still, it burns."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.24.a: "One day, he’ll regret this."

 GOT_Diplomatic_Country.25.t: "The Dragon Queen’s Offer"
 GOT_Diplomatic_Country.25.d: "Daenerys Targaryen has offered us a deal: one of her dragons in exchange for our Unsullied — 8,000 fully trained soldiers and 5,000 more still in training. With such a creature, we could unlock the secrets of dragonkind and begin studying their power for ourselves. But without the Unsullied, Astapor would be left nearly defenseless. Accepting could bring us knowledge beyond imagining—or doom at the hands of the Targaryens if they choose to take what we refuse to sell."
 GOT_Diplomatic_Country.25.a: "Accept the deal. The dragon will be ours."
 GOT_Diplomatic_Country.25.b: "Refuse. We cannot leave ourselves exposed."
 
  GOT_Diplomatic_Country.26.t: "The Unsullied Are Ours"
 GOT_Diplomatic_Country.26.d: "The slavers of Astapor have agreed to the deal. One of our dragons now rests in their hands, and in return, the Unsullied—13,000 strong—stand ready to march under our banner. Missandei, once their translator, now joins us as well. Yet the city is vulnerable. Stripped of its elite troops and gorging on the promise of dragon power, Astapor lies wide open. Should we keep our word… or strike while their defenses are down?"
 GOT_Diplomatic_Country.26.a: "They are slavers. We strike now and burn them to the ground."
 GOT_Diplomatic_Country.26.b: "We've made our deal. Sail for Pentos with the Unsullied."
 
 GOT_Diplomatic_Country.27.t: "A Foolish Refusal"
 GOT_Diplomatic_Country.27.d: "Astapor has rejected our offer. They refuse to part with the Unsullied, fearing vulnerability. They would rather hold on to their slave army than embrace the gift of a dragon. It is a bold insult. We could sail away and bide our time—or we could unleash fire and blood upon them now."
 GOT_Diplomatic_Country.27.a: "They will regret this. Prepare to attack Astapor."
 GOT_Diplomatic_Country.27.b: "Very well. Let them have their slaves… for now."

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.28.d:0 "An emissary from Yunkai has arrived under a banner of peace. Bearing word from the Wise Masters, he offers one hundred ships and promises of non-aggression in exchange for our departure. They claim they wish to avoid bloodshed, though their chains still rattle in the streets. Shall we accept their offer of ships and stand down—for now—or continue our march and bring fire and blood to the city?"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.28.a:0 "Accept the ships and their pact—for now."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.28.b:0 "I will not make pacts with slavers. Prepare for war."

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.29.t:0 "The Dragon Queen Accepts"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.29.d:0 "Our emissary has returned with unexpected news: Daenerys Targaryen has agreed to our terms. She will leave Yunkai unharmed in exchange for one hundred ships and a promise of non-aggression. Though her dragons remain at her side, it seems—for now—that fire and blood have been stayed by gold and diplomacy."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.29.a:0 "A wise outcome. Let us hope it lasts."

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.30.t:0 "The Dragon Queen Refuses"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.30.d:0 "Our emissary has failed. Daenerys Targaryen rejected our offer of gold and ships without hesitation. She means to bring war upon us, and soon the hammer of her Unsullied and the fire of her dragons may fall upon our gates. The Masters grow restless—some urge a preemptive strike, while others argue we should wait and fortify the city."
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.30.a:0 "Strike first before she gathers her full strength."

GOT_Diplomatic_Country.33.t: "Tormund Captured"
GOT_Diplomatic_Country.33.d: "Tormund Giantsbane, the legendary leader of the Free Folk, has been captured by our enemies.

Yet now, the Freys have betrayed us, revealing their true loyalties. Even worse, our own bannermen, the Boltons, have cast aside their loyalty to the North.

Yet, when Lord Walder Frey presented his terms for forgiveness, we spurned him, rejecting his demands outright. Now, the Freys have revealed their true loyalties, and our former bannermen, the Boltons, have followed suit. Lord Roose Bolton has betrayed us, casting aside his loyalty and marching with our enemies.\n\nWhile we fight on for the realm, our enemies, once within our own ranks, now rise in revolt against us."

His murder has left a void at the heart of House Lannister, and with it, a dangerous question: who shall inherit the Rock?\n\nKevan Lannister stands as a loyal and steady hand. Jaime, the Kingslayer, is still a son of the Rock—but bound to the Kingsguard. Cersei, ever proud, may claim the mantle herself, or through her surviving children.

With great courtesy and acknowledgment of past hospitality, they note that House Targaryen has now secured lands of its own, and respectfully request the return of Illyrio Mopatis' mansion. They emphasize that this request comes not from malice, but from the understanding that their generous gesture of asylum is no longer necessary now that the Targaryens are no longer destitute wanderers."
