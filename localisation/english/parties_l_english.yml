 DR_subideology:0 "Benevolent Rule"

This system emphasizes leaders who rule with kindness and fairness, ensuring prosperity through cooperation, dialogue, and mutual respect, while balancing the needs of the people with the strength of the state."
 CR_subideology:0 "Tribal Rule"
 CR_subideology_desc:0 "Tribal Rule is a way of life built on communal bonds, shared survival, and defiance of distant rulers. Leadership is earned through strength, wisdom, or tradition rather than imposed by birth or decree. The people live as one, rejecting the shackles of kings and lords, sharing resources, and defending their freedom with steel and fire. It is a world of warriors, nomads, and clans, where the strong lead with the trust of their kin, and the only law is the will of the people."
 FR_subideology:0 "Tyrannical Rule"
 FR_subideology_desc:0 "Tyrannical Rule advocates for absolute control by a singular, strong leader, often achieved through force and manipulation. The state is supreme, and the individual is subordinate to the collective will of the nation. Military might, oppression of dissent, and authoritarian control are the pillars upon which this ideology stands."
 NR_subideology:0 "Traditional Rule"
 NR_subideology_desc:0 "Traditional Rule emphasizes the preservation of age-old institutions, often ruled by monarchy or aristocracy. The ideology holds that stability, continuity, and respect for tradition are paramount in maintaining order.

White_Walker_subideology:0 "The Eternal Night"
White_Walker_subideology_desc:0 "An unrelenting force of ice and death, the White Walkers seek to extinguish all warmth and life from the world. They do not govern, negotiate, or tolerate opposition—only the cold remains. With every fallen foe reborn as an instrument of their will, their dominion is inevitable, an empire of the undead under an eternal winter."
